# Mandelbrot-set-in-Fortran-Computation-and-Visualization-with-Gnuplot
Fortran implementation of the Mandelbrot set: point-by-point numerical computation, recording the iteration count until divergence, and scientific visualization with gnuplot using color gradients. A classical example of iterative methods and numerical plotting.
